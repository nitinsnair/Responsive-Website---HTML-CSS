# A Basic Page using HTML

This project was created **without** using the auto complete option or Emmet. This was to get familiar with pure HTML concepts.

**Key learnings:** HTML is a markup language, used to define, arrange and structure the content and layout of a page. The most basic unit of any HTML code is called an Element. An element is made up of 3 parts - Opening Tag, Content and Closing Tag. </

One exception is the img (Image) tag. 'Img' doesnt have a closing tag since it doesnt have any content in between. So, instead we use something called an attribute.

An attribute is a piece of data that provides additional information to the element in which we are using it, and as a result governs its behaviour.

For Eg., This is the syntax for inserting an image in an HTML file:-

    <img src="enter url(or path) of the image" width="x"/>

'src' is an attribute that fetches image from a given source or path.

"width" is another attribute that defines the width of an image.

An HTML page consists of two main parts -- The Head and the Body

_Head_ - This part of the HTML page contains data that is not printed on the screen.

_Body_ - This is the main area that contains all the content of the page.

**Semantic HTML:-** This is an HTML5 concept that makes a page more readable and meaningful for both browsers and fellow programers.

For instance, earlier, in order to bold a text, we used 'b' tag. But with HTML5, we prefer using 'strong', as it is semantically more accurate. Similarly, for italics, the 'i' tag has been replaced with a much accurate 'emphasis' tag. Tags like 'nav' for Navigation bar, 'aside' for related content, 'article' for article sections etc. are all part of this concept called Semantic HTML.

I also learnt about 'a' tags, Unordered lists, Ordered lists etc.
